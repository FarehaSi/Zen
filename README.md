# Zen Yoga Club 
<a href="https://farehasi.github.io/Zen/" target="_blank">Zen Yoga Club</a> allows the owner to reach potential students and perhaps open the door to teaching online. The objective is to have an online presence where clients can sign up and book a class. The website provides an overview on what the club is about and how individuals can connect with the club. It is targeted at an adult audience that live busy lives and want to relax. Zen Yoga Club provides them a platform to do just that.

## Features
The site provides users with three key sections. Foremost, an ‘About Us’ section providing an overview of what the club is about and who runs it. Secondly, a ‘Benefits of Yoga’ section that entices users to join the club. The third section consists of a sign-up page where users can connect with the club. There also exists a contact menu to social links at the bottom of all the pages.

<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
<li>A ‘Reviews’ page of existing clients. This will bring more credibility to the website.</li>
<h2>Testing</h2>
The website has been tested using chrome developer tools to emulate different screen sizes. Media queries have been used for responsive CSS to ensure better user experience. For example, multi row layouts collapse into single columns on smaller screens.
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<h4>Solved bugs</h4>
<ul><li>The header, positioned sticky, did not not display as the home page was scrolled down on the background video positioned relative. This was rectified by giving the header a z-index property with the value of 1.</li>
<li>As media queries were applied to the menu in the header, the background colour property of the header did not function any longer. Giving the header a display property with the value of flow-root resolved the problem.</li></ul>
<h3>Validator Testing</h3>
<ul><li>No errors were returned when passing the HTML code through the W3C validator</li>
<li>No errors were found when passing the CSS code through the Jigsaw validator</li></ul>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
The site was deployed to GitHub pages.
